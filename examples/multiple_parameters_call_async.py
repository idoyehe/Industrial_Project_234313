"""
Simple PyWren examples using one single function invocation
with multiple parameters.

You can send multiple parameters to a single call function
writing them into a list. The parameters will be mapped in
the order you wrote them. In the following example the x 
parameter will take the value 3 and the y parameter will 
take the value 6.

The parameters can also be sent into a dictionary. In this
case you have to map them to the correct parameter of the
function as in the next example.

If you want to send a list or a dict as a parameter of the

example.
