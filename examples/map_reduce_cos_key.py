"""
Simple PyWren example using the map_reduce method which
counts the number of words inside each object specified
in 'iterdata' variable.

This example processes some objects which are in COS.
Be sure you have a bucket named 'sample_data' and the
objects object1, object2 and object3 inside it.

Otherwise, you can change the 'iterdata' variable and
point to some existing objects in your COS account.

As in this case you are processing objects from COS, the
map_reduce() method will first launch a partitioner to split
the objects in smaller chunks, thus increasing the parallelism
of the execution and reducing the total time needed to process
the data. After creating the partitions, it will launch one
map function for each partition, and one reducer for all
partitions of the same object. In this case you will get
one result for each object specified in 'iterdata' variable.

Note that when you want to process objects stored in COS,
the 'key' and the 'data_stream' parameters are mandatory
in the parameters of the map function.

In the reduce function there will be always one parameter
from where you can access to the partial results.
